# Cuda-mutichannel-convolution
 This is a realization of CUDA convolution, using global memory and shared memory
,require cuda11.5 and vs2017. It compares the cpu realization, cuda global memory and shared memory realization of mutichannel convolution with input image 3*1024*1024, kernel of 64*3*3*3(out*in*kernel_size*kernel_size)
